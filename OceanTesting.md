Help build the data to combat ocean acidification.

We are now in a situation where ocean sample testing can be done by anyone, and our goal is get a preponderance of sea water data to help scientists understand how prevalent and how intense the problem is.

$('.count').each(function () {
    $(this).prop('Counter',0).animate({
        Counter: $(this).text()
    }, {
        duration: 4000,
        easing: 'swing',
        step: function (now) {
            $(this).text(Math.ceil(now));
        }

Our Goal is to empower every traveller to check the Ph of the ocean water. <br>
<br>
Just take a sample of the local water.  Send it to us.<br>
<br>
The oceans are getting more acidic, and this has a direct result on the ability of coral to grow.

The scientific establishment is tracking ocean acidification at various locations around the world.<br>

Most scientists believe that ocean acidification is a direct result of the increase in the Carbin DiOxide concentration of the atmosphere. We can see below that the CO2 measured is steadily rising.<br>
<br>

<br>
And we can see that this rise is accelerating on average each year as seen below.<br>

<br>
We can also see that there is a seasonal variation of carbon DiOxide concentration as seen here. Hence it is very important for all of our samples to be labelled with the sample date to accurately plot the data.<br>

<br>
In addition, many scientists also believe that this increase in Carbon DiOxide concentration is a direct result of human activity as seen below.<br>
