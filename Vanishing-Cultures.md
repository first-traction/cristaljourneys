			Vanishing Cultures \
			With the onslaught of technology, the world continues to shrink. \
			Our world is increasing global, where our products are made in one country, assembled in another, transshipped via another, and in the end consumed on still another continent. The world of commerce functions at the speed of money, and that which aids commerce inexorably succeeds. The cultures, traditions of the local and indigenous peoples often suffer.\
			The American heritage of destroying the local culture of the American Indians as the west was claimed was neither the first nor the last chapter in progress's subjugation of a people. Universally, the American Indian experience is one that other cultures do not want to repeat. Consistent with the idea of self-determination, many cultures are choosing the path of sustainable development instead of being dominated by commerce, non local enterprises and the like. There are shining examples of small cultures progressing yet preserving their underlying philosophy and culture. The Kunas of Panama are a shining example, embracing some of the ways of the modern world, but holding them in their own cultural context.\
			The concept of eco-tourism is built around this basic sustainable principle. Explore the various cultures of the world, and you may find a place you want to visit.\
			link to our  Eco-tourism page, see what it is, how it works, and find resources to help one explore the multitudinous cultures of our world.\
			The listing of vanishing cultures below is by no means exhaustive. There are so many cultures and sub-cultures that including them all here are too impossible a task to contemplate. We have listed those cultures that have separated themselves and attempt to live a life consistent with their traditions, are attempting to preserve their unique languages, and view themselves as separate enclaves in a broader world. \
