Why Eco-travel? People eco-travel to find sensational experiences that are becoming as rare as the species they hope to see.
<br>
Eco-travel re-awakens the soul by bringing us in touch with our physical natural world. It is a philosophical approach equivalent to the Hippocratic Oath and doctor\'92s credo" do no harm". When we travel we leave nature as we left it, and our interaction with the animals and peoples we contact is respectful of them. 

How comfortable is eco-travel? <br>
There are as many different approaches to eco-travel as there are destinations. Some people prefer 5 star luxury and comfortable ways to experience nature, and others want rugged adventure. We customize each trip to fit our client\'92s level of interaction with the environment. The most popular form is a combination of the two, where there are short periods of ruggedness and high contact with the animals and people we encounter, ending with stays in luxury accommodations to freshen up, hot showers and hot towels, and then finishing up each trip with trip extensions to the best of the beaches of the world for several days of rest, sun, and adventure before returning home.
